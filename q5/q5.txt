a.  cost of projection using sorting for duplicate removal

Read original file = 200
Write projected file = 100
Sort (2 passes over 100 pages) = 2 * 100 * 2 = 400
Write final result = 80

Total cost using sorting = 200 + 100 + 400 + 80 = 780 pages


b.  cost of projection using hashing for duplicate removal

Read original file = 200
Write hash partitions = 100
Read hash partitions = 100
Write final result = 80

Total cost using hashing = 200 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 480 pages
